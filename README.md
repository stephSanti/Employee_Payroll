## Employee Payroll Tracker 

This project simulates a payroll sheet with fictional employee data (names, hourly wages, and hours worked). I used Excel formulas to automatically calculate:
	•	Overtime hours
	•	Base pay
	•	Overtime bonus
	•	Total pay per employee
	•	Summary statistics (Max, Min, Average, and Total Pay)

🔑 Key Formulas Used
	•	Overtime Hours: =IF(D4>40, D4-40, 0)
	•	Base Pay: =C4*D4
	•	Overtime Bonus: =0.5*C4*E4
	•	Total Pay: =F4+G4

📂 What’s Included
	•	EmployeePayroll.xlsx — Spreadsheet with 50 fictional employees
	•	Built-in formulas to automate pay calculations
	•	Clean layout for easy analysis
	•	Summary section for payroll insights (max, min, average, total)

⚠️ All employee names and data are randomly generated and not based on real individuals.
